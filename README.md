The goal of this project is to build a sales dashboard that provides key insights into the sales and profitability of products across various states, categories, and sub-categories over time. The dashboard should help the business identify top-performing products, trends in sales and profit, and areas requiring attention based on performance metrics. 

Key objectives:
1. Display total sales, profit, and quantity sold.
2. Analyze sales, profit, and quantity trends across months.
3. Identify the top 5 products by profit and sales.
4. Provide a breakdown of sub-categories and their profit and profit percentage.
5. Enable filtering by years, states, and product categories.
6. Visualize profit percentage using conditional formatting to highlight key performance thresholds.

### Steps Followed:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
   - Imported sales data, which includes fields such as product name, category, sub-category, sales amount, profit, state, and year.
   - Cleaned the dataset by ensuring no missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring consistent formats for dates and product details.

2. Data Analysis and Aggregation:
   - Aggregated the data to calculate total sales, total profit, and total quantity sold for each product, category, sub-category, and state.
   - Calculated monthly trends for sales, profit, and quantity by grouping data by month and year.

3. Top 5 Products by Sales and Profit:
   - Ranked products based on total profit and sales to identify the top 5 products.
   - Visualized the top 5 products using bar charts, showcasing both sales and profit for each.

4. Sales, Profit, and Quantity Trend Analysis:
   - Created line charts to show the monthly trends for sales, profit, and quantity sold.
   - This helps visualize the fluctuation in performance over the months and identify any seasonal patterns.

5. Sub-Category Profit Table and Conditional Formatting:
   - Generated a table displaying the profit and profit percentage for each sub-category.
   - Applied conditional formatting to the profit percentage:
     - Red for profit percentages below 40%.
     - Yellow for profit percentages between 40-60%.
     - Green for profit percentages above 60%.
   - This visual indicator helps quickly identify low and high-performing sub-categories.

6. Slicers for Dynamic Filtering:
   - Added slicers for Years, States, and Categories to enable users to dynamically filter the data and view specific segments of interest.
   - This allows for an interactive exploration of the dataset based on time, geographical location, and product type.

7. Visualization Design and Formatting:
   - Used a purple color scheme for a cohesive and clear visual presentation.
   - Organized the dashboard into sections: Key metrics (sales, profit, quantity), top products, monthly trends, sub-category table, and slicers.

  3. Total Units Sold: 37,873 units
  4. Top 5 Products: The top products in terms of profit include printers and copiers, such as the HP Designjet T520 and Canon imageCLASS 2200.
  5. Profitability by Sub-Category: Categories like labels (79.92%) and envelopes (73.21%) have the highest profit percentages, while others like bookcases (-2.93%) and tables (-7.89%) are underperforming.
  6. Monthly Trends: The highest sales and profit occurred in March and July, showing potential seasonal patterns.

### Conclusion:
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the businessâ€™s sales and profitability metrics. The ability to filter by year, state, and category allows users to derive insights relevant to specific time frames and locations. Conditional formatting applied to the profit percentages highlights areas where the business should focus its attention to improve performance. In summary, the dashboard serves as an effective tool for decision-makers to analyze performance, optimize product lines, and strategize for increased profitability.
